# pyPingPong

The plan for this program is to eventually become integrated in to a Raspberry Pi setup with buttons and a web front end but just now it's a console app.

This is my first Python program so I welcome any comments on how to do things better.

## Tasks / To do list
+ Handle 2 players playing up to 11 points
+ Handle a tie break 
+ Inform players when to change service
+ Create a leaderboard - players name, number of wins. Hook in to database 
+ Show over all result, best of 3 games. 

## Possible frontend things
+ Maybe need to learn SignalR to make realtime score updates? 
+ Possibly use Django
